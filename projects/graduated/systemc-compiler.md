# Project application: Intel&reg; Compiler for SystemC*

*\*Other names and brands may be claimed as the property of others.*

## Application

### Sandbox application

* Project name: Intel&reg; Compiler for SystemC*
* Project repo(s): https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler
* Brief summary of the project: Open source SystemC to SystemVerilog translation tool and library
* Project's open source license: Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions
* Link to issue tracker: https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/issues
* Link to website: https://github.com/intel/systemc-compiler/wiki
* Links to social media accounts: N/A
* Who uses this project, and at what scale: The Intel Compiler for SystemC (ICSC) translates synthesizable SystemC design to synthesizable SystemVerilog design. The tool is an open source alternative to commercial high-level synthesis (HLS) tools. The ICSC contains common components library with a general FIFO, base class to create user-defined channels and temporal SystemC assertions synthesizable to SystemVerilog assertions (SVA). The project is currently used by Intel (a few SoC silicons taped out and a few more are in progress), evaluated by Google engineers and used by open source community.
* Why does the project want to join CHIPS Alliance: Joining CHIPS Alliance will allow a broader adoption of ICSC and a wider cooperation with CHIPS Alliance members.
* Primary contact from the project during the Sandbox application process:
  * Name: Mikhail Moiseev
  * Email: mikhail.moiseev@intel.com
  * GitHub handle: @mikhailmoiseev
  * Role within the project: Maintainer, committer
