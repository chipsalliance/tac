# Graduated projects

CHIPS Alliance uses a [project lifecycle process](/README.md#lifecycle) to categorize current and prospective projects.

For a list of Graduated projects, see the files in the current directory (one per project), naturally excluding this README.

In the future, this repository will be used as a base to generate a more structured summary of all CHIPS projects.
