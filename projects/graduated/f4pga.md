# Project application: FOSS Flow for FPGA (F4PGA)

## Application

### Sandbox application

* Project name: FOSS Flow for FPGA (F4PGA)
* Project repo(s): https://github.com/f4pga/f4pga
* Brief summary of the project: Free and open source toolchain for FPGA devices
* Project's open source license: Apache-2.0
* Link to issue tracker: https://github.com/f4pga/f4pga/issues
* Link to website: https://f4pga.org
* Links to social media accounts: N/A
* Who uses this project, and at what scale: The `F4PGA` project (previously Symbiflow) aims to deliver fully open source end-to-end FPGA toolchain targeting chips from verious vendors. Beside the main toolchain, the project develops many smaller tools easing e.g. research on FPGA security.  The project is used by a wide range of entities - Google, Antmicro (the main contributors), a number of universities and FPGA vendors (QuickLogic), and the wider academic and open source FPGA community.
* Why does the project want to join CHIPS Alliance: Joining CHIPS Alliance will allow a broader adoption of F4PGA and a wider cooperation with CHIPS Alliance members.
