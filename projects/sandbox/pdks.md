# Project application: Open source PDKs & Workgroup

To apply to become a CHIPS Alliance project, copy this template to the relevant subfolder of [this directory](https://github.com/chipsalliance/tsc/tree/main/projects) and open a PR against the TSC repo and add the `tsc-meeting` label. Projects applying for Sandbox status should add the `sandbox-application` label. Projects applying for Graduated status should add the `graduated-application` label.

For simplicity, the CHIPS Alliance TSC uses a progressive application for Sandbox and Graduated status. The Graduated application includes all of the Sandbox questions. Project candidate should complete as much of the application as possible, as this will help determine which level is most appropriate.

When applying to move from Sandbox » Graduated, please modify the existing application and update relevant fields (such as number of committers) so that the file's history is preserved.

If a specific field is not applicable to your project (e.g. your project does not have dedicated social media accounts), please use N/A to signify this.

## Application

### Sandbox application

* Project name: Open source PDKs & Workgroup
* Project repo(s):
  - https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk
  - https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk  
* Brief summary of the project: Open source process design kits for the SkyWater Technology 130nm and GlobalFoundries 180MCU manufacturing processes.  These GitHub repos are currently maintained by Google, but proposing to move them into CHIPS Alliance and to form a new workgroup for governance moving forward. 
* Project's open source license: Apache-2.0
* Link to issue tracker:
  - https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk/issues 
  - https://github.com/google/gf180mcu-pdk/issues 
* Link to website: N/A
* Links to social media accounts: N/A
* Who uses this project, and at what scale: Commercial chip designers, academic researchers, educators, students, and hobbyists have created over 700 projects based on these PDKs. Projects have been manufactured via Google’s [Open MPW Shuttle program](https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program) and [efabless’](https://efabless.com/) chipIgnite service.
* Why does the project want to join CHIPS Alliance: To take open source PDKs to the next level, Google seeks to advance our initial PDK efforts by “graduating” them out of Google and into a sustainable, ecosystem-driven governance model. This effort has an initial approval via governing board vote (October 5, 2023) and is now applying for sandbox status and TSC consideration.  With sandbox status, we will work towards drafting the mission statement and workgroup charter before applying for graduation to instantiate the rest of the project and workgroup.

* Primary contact from the project during the Sandbox application process:
  * Name: Aaron Cunningham
  * Email: aacunningham@google.com
  * GitHub handle: cunninghamsandwich
  * Role within the project: Technical Program Manager
