# Project application: Diplomacy SoC Framework

## Application

### Sandbox application

* Project name: Diplomacy SoC Framework
* Project repo(s): https://github.com/chipsalliance/diplomacy/
* Brief summary of the project: a SoC framework based on Chisel.
* Project's open source license: Apache 2.0
* Link to issue tracker: https://github.com/chipsalliance/diplomacy/issues
* Link to website: N/A
* Links to social media accounts: N/A
* Who uses this project, and at what scale: RocketChip, FireSim, Boom, XiangShan, and other Chisel projects which depends on a configurable SoC.
* Why does the project want to join CHIPS Alliance: This project used to belong to RocketChip, however since RocketChip is too large to maintain a stable API, I'm considering to split diplomacy out of RocketChip and to publish it to maven. Different interconnect protocols(TileLink, AXI/ACE, Wishbone) can depend on Diplomacy to provide a general interconnect API to users.
