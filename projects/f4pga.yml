# Brief summary of how widely the project is used e.g. list of companies
project_usage_and_scale: The `F4PGA` project (previously Symbiflow) aims to deliver fully open source end-to-end FPGA toolchain targeting chips from verious vendors. Beside the main toolchain, the project develops many smaller tools easing e.g. research on FPGA security.  The project is used by a wide range of entities - Google, Antmicro (the main contributors), a number of universities and FPGA vendors (QuickLogic), and the wider academic and open source FPGA community.
# Project's motivation to join CHIPS
why_join_chips: Joining CHIPS Alliance will allow a broader adoption of F4PGA and a wider cooperation with CHIPS Alliance members.
