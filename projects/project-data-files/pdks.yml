# Brief summary of how widely the project is used e.g. list of companies
project_usage_and_scale: Commercial chip designers, academic researchers, educators, students, and hobbyists have created over 700 projects based on these PDKs. Projects have been manufactured via Google’s [Open MPW Shuttle program](https://efabless.com/open_shuttle_program) and [efabless’](https://efabless.com/) chipIgnite service.
# Project's motivation to join CHIPS
why_join_chips: To take open source PDKs to the next level, Google seeks to advance our initial PDK efforts by “graduating” them out of Google and into a sustainable, ecosystem-driven governance model. This effort has an initial approval via governing board vote (October 5, 2023) and is now applying for sandbox status and TSC consideration.  With sandbox status, we will work towards drafting the mission statement and workgroup charter before applying for graduation to instantiate the rest of the project and workgroup.
