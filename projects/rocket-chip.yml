# Brief summary of how widely the project is used e.g. list of companies
project_usage_and_scale: The `RocketChip` project aims to provide a RISC-V SoC generateor written in Chisel, including the rocket core; diplomacy SoC generation framework; TileLink-based cache, periphery IPs, FPGA generators. This project used to be contributed by UCB and SiFive. For now, it is maintained by UCB and PLCT Lab.
# Project's motivation to join CHIPS
why_join_chips: RocketChip was the one of the first few projects of CHIPS, it provides an IP family and SoC generator for open-source ASIC designs.
