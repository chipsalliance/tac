# Brief summary of how widely the project is used e.g. list of companies
project_usage_and_scale: The Intel Compiler for SystemC (ICSC) translates synthesizable SystemC design to equivalent SystemVerilog design. The tool is an open source alternative to commercial high-level synthesis (HLS) tools. The ICSC contains common components library with a general FIFO, base class to create user-defined channels and temporal SystemC assertions synthesizable to SVA. The project is currently used by several teams at Intel and open source community.
# Project's motivation to join CHIPS
why_join_chips: Joining CHIPS Alliance will allow a broader adoption of ICSC and a wider cooperation with CHIPS Alliance members.
