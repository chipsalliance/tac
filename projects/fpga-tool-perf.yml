# Brief summary of how widely the project is used e.g. list of companies
project_usage_and_scale: The `fpga-tool-perf` repository is used to automatically benchmark performance of various FPGA toolchains and present the results in a human readable form. The `actions` repository provides a number of useful GitHub actions used for testing and publishing FPGA development tools. The project is used by Google, Antmicro, and the wider open source FPGA community like the VTR project.
# Project's motivation to join CHIPS
