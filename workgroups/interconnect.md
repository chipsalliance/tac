The Interconnect workgroup researches open networking protocols to facilitate direct coherency messaging between components such as processor caches, memory controllers, and various accelerators in RISC-V cores. The interconnections provided by this group play a crucial role in SoCs, chiplets, and various hardware designs. We offer design guidelines for interconnects and manage open-source interconnect IP based on these guidelines. Interconnect WG supports the advancement of the open-source hardware ecosystem.
