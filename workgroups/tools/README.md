# Tools Workgroup

The Tools workgroup (WG) of CHIPS Alliance covers a wide array of open source tooling for ASIC and FPGA design, mostly focusing around digital design (as there is a separate Analog WG that focuses on AMS design flows).

## Mission

The mission of the Tools WG will be to:

* identify open source tools in the ASIC / FPGA domain and help them collaborate and interoperate
* share and co-develop new, open source based ASIC / FPGA design methodologies
* discuss and share experiences related to digital ASIC / FPGA design to identify gaps in the existing ecosystem and potential improvements
* identify neighboring areas where the application of open source ASIC / FPGA design methodologies could result in radical improvements (e.g. chiplets, memory designs etc.)
* identify ways to use open source tools in production-level, marketable solutions, and raise awareness of success stories

## Collaboration

### Mailing list

Anyone is allowed to join and participate on [the `tools-wg` mailing list](https://lists.chipsalliance.org/g/tools-wg/).

### Calendar

Meetings and events will be posted on the main [CHIPS Alliance calendar](https://calendar.chipsalliance.org).
