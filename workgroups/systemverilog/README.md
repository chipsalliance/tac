# SystemVerilog Workgroup

The SystemVerilog workgroup was formed by the CHIPS Alliance TSC to explore collaborations in open source tools for SystemVerilog development/verification.

## Mission

The mission of the SystemVerilog WG will be to:

* help in the development of CHIPS Alliance's SystemVerilog projects such as Verible, Surelog, UHDM etc.
* identify open source IP and tools in/for SystemVerilog and help them flourish
* share and co-develop new, open source tools for working with SystemVerilog
* discuss and share experiences related to SystemVerilog usage to identify gaps in the existing ecosytstem and potential improvements
