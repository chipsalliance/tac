The F4PGA Workgroup was formed to drive open source tooling, IP cores and research for FPGA devices. It includes three major groups whose collaboration is critical to the success of the open source approach in this space: FPGA vendors, industrial users and university members. Its main focus is enabling rapid prototyping and software-driven development of FPGA-oriented systems in areas such as ML and video processing. The workgroup provides an open collaboration platform for its members, aiming at accelerating the speed of innovation in FPGAs and the general availability of the technology. The initial projects contributed into CHIPS Alliance within the F4PGA Workgroup are focused around the free and open source FPGA toolchain formerly known as SymbiFlow, as well as the so-called FPGA Interchange format.
