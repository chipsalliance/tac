The SystemVerilog Tools workgroup (WG) of CHIPS Alliance covers a wide array of open source SystemVerilog tooling for ASIC and FPGA design, mostly focusing around digital design (as there is a separate Analog WG that focuses on AMS design flows). The topics covered include simulation, synthesis, place and route, IP aggregation, linting, formatting, and many more.
