# Analog Working Group

The Analog working group was formed by the CHIPS Alliance TSC to explore collaborations in Analog design and verification.

## Mission

The mission of the Analog WG will be to:

* identify open source IP in the Analog/Mixed-Signal domain and help it flourish
* share and co-develop new, open source based design methodologies in the Analog/Mixed-Signal space (such as generators and generator frameworks)
* discuss and share experiences related to Analog/Mixed-Signal design to identify gaps in the existing ecosytstem and potential improvements
* identify neigboring areas where open source Analog/Mixed-Signal design methodologies and IP could result in radical improvements (e.g. chiplets, memory designs etc.)

## Collaboration

### Mailing list

Anyone is allowed to join and participate on [the `analog-wg` mailing list](https://lists.chipsalliance.org/g/analog-wg/).
