### Welcome

Henry called the meeting to order at 11:26 am on January 27. Brian provided a welcome and overview of the TSC and its role in the CHIPS Alliance.

### Review of TSC meeting procedures

Brian next reviewed the TSC meeting procedures. He noted that Henry, as the appointed chair, is currently the sole TSC member. As projects are accepted to the TSC, each will nominate their voting member and the TSC will grow. In the meantime, Henry will adopt the various documents so the TSC can be boostrapped.

Brian reviewed quorum requirements for TSC meetings, noting that quorum is defined as be a majority of voting members. He next reviewed the decision-making process, and noted that the goal is to have lightweight procedures that encourage efficient decision-making. To this end, as many decisions as possible will be consensus-based, among those who participate in the conversation. Brian noted that the meetings are open to anybody to participate, voting and non-voting members alike. The formal voting process is to be used primarily when a decision can't be made by consensus, either because no consensus is reached or because it's required to be a vote in by the charter.

### Adopt the [TSC charter](https://technical-charter.chipsalliance.org)

Brian noted that as the initial and sole member of the TSC, Henry can instantiate the TSC by adopting the TSC charter.

As the TSC chair, Henry adopted the CHIPS Alliance TSC charter.

1. Approve [README.md](https://github.com/chipsalliance/tsc/blob/main/README.md) (Brian, Henry)

Brian reviewed the policies and procedures in the README, noting that this is meant to ensure that polices are clear and consistent. He noted that the TSC is a self-governing body, and that it has the ability to modify policies and procedures as needed, subject to constraints documented in the Charter.

As the initial and sole member of the TSC, Henry approved the policies and procedures document.

1. Approve [drafts/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chipsalliance/tsc/blob/main/drafts/CONTRIBUTING.md) (Brian, Henry)

Brian next noted that the CONTRIBUTING.md file outlines common open governance principles expected of CHIPS Alliance projects. He noted that each project may vary slightly, for example, using the term "Maintainers" instead of "Committers", but that the general principles should apply across projects.

1. Discuss additional TSC members (Brian, Henry)

Brian next suggested that Henry appoint additional temporary TSC members to help with the process of onboarding projects. This would be for the bootstrap phase, until the TSC has a sufficient number of onboarded projects, each with a TSC voting member. Brian suggested Michael, as he has been actively involved in the process of drafting the documents. Henry agreed, and appointed Michael as a temporary TSC voting member.

1. Review meeting times

Brian noted that in a prior discussion with Henry and Michael, there was a suggestion for the TSC to meet on the 4th Wednesday of the month at 11a ET.

Action: Brian to add the standing TSC meeting to the [CHIPS Alliance calendar](https://calendar.chipsalliance.org)

### Adjournment

Henry closed the meeting at 11:50 am ET.
